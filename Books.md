**This is the comprehensive list of books that I read and I intend to read. It's a never ending journey and to be lost amongst these
is like finding yourself**

Books give a soul to the universe,
wings to the mind,
flight to the imagination, 
and life to everything

- The First three minutes by Steven Weinberg  
```
Listed as one of the great books of Physics, this one talks about the beginning of the Universe.
It's quite fascinating to think about what really would have happened in those initial moments.
This book creates a kind of timeline and takes you on a journey at the beginning of time so to say.
A great book! And must read for people interested in Physics in general and Cosmology in particular.
