**This is the comprehensive list of books that I have read and I intend to read. It's a never ending journey and to be lost amongst these
is like finding yourself**

Books give a soul to the universe,
wings to the mind,
flight to the imagination, 
and life to everything

- The First three minutes by Steven Weinberg  
```
Listed as one of the great books of Physics, this one talks about the beginning of the Universe.
It's quite fascinating to think about what really would have happened in those initial moments.
This book creates a kind of timeline and takes you on a journey at the beginning of time so to say.
A great book! And must read for people interested in Physics in general and Cosmology in particular. 
```
- Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse (1922)
```
Being dead and being alive always go hand in hand, but they are distinguished from each other just by a breath.
Likewise, being awakened and being unawakened exist side by side, but they always remain apart from each other 
just by a thought
```
- Origin by Dan Brown
```
An ExtraOrdinary account of another Robert Lagdon story. Gripping, thoughtful and insightful. I seem to be a 
little biased with all of the Dan Brown stories - the reason being his articulative nature of story telling. 
Blend of history is like icing on the cake. Enjoy reading it.
```
- Inferno by Dan Brown
```
A marvel in itself. Personally was compelled to read more about Dante Aligheri and his work The Divine Comedy
after the reference in this book.
```
- The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown
```
Personal favourite amongst all Dan Brown Novels. Impossible to put down.
```
- The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown
```
The world knows more than what I can comprehend about this book.
```
- Angels and Demons by Dan Brown
```
Stupendous.
